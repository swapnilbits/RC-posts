************
    The ariplanes/drones that I have listed here as my favourites are mainly because of 1) revolutionary technology in them 2) Possible impact they would cause  in the world if they are implemented and mass-produced 3) Never-seen-before features 4) Awesome design and last but not least 5) My biased opinions XD. I have picked these models from the comprehensive list that I have provided in folder "swapnil" under the filename 
    LINK: provides exclusive video/article/website related to a particular model that features only that model.
    INFOLINK: provides youtube video/website link in which that model is also featured alongwith many other models. In case it's a video, check the video description to know at what interval of the video, is that model discussed and featured.
    SUGGESTION: I would recommend to watch infolinks over links, because link videos are long and comprehensive, while infolink videos are short and summarized. Although you would have to toil a bit to locate the model in the infolink video, but it's better than the former. However, if you really wanna understand the mechanics and detailed info regarding a particular model, then go ahead with the link.
    ORDER OF LISTING: There are five catogeries that I have provided here - PLANES, DRONES, BIONIC planes/drones, HYBRIDS and UTILLITY DRONE/RC MODELS. The models that I have listed in each category are in descending order in terms of revolutionary technology, innovation, relevance, future potential and design.
