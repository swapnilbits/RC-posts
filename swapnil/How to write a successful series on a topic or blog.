Why Run A Post/Blog Series? 
***************************

>> People have short attention spans. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but most people don’t hang on your (or my) every word. Most people scan or skim posts. Shorter posts are better for today’s short-attention span readers.
>> Complex posts are hard to digest. There’s nothing that scares a reader off than a too-long or too involved post. When we create a series, it’s easier for people to manage.
>> To maximize our writing effort. Why spend hours writing a 2000-word tome, put it all in one post and then have to do it all again the next day? By stretching out posts into series, you’re able to more easily fill your editorial calendar.
>> To grab the SEO benefit. Offering a series of related posts allows us to interlink the posts between them, which helps with your SEO!
>> To increase our return visitors. If we write a great opening post to a series, chances are people will come back for subsequent installments.

10 Steps of Efficient blogging:
********************************

1) IDENTIFY A TOPIC : Always choose a topic that is large enough to warrant multiple posts( don't write a series just for sake of it), but manageable enough not to overwhelm us. A series can be described as an X-part series. E.g. 5 part series, 8 past series. Usually one idea can be churned into mulitple posts, if they are pondered enough upon. Comments and questions from readers are often key in triggering ideas for topics, which in turn leads to a series of posts.

2) WRITE A LIST : We must consider taking up a topic big enough for a series. Generally starting off with a brainstorming session and compiling a list of the main points proves helpful. Lists generally start out as bullet point lists of keywords and phrases. Adding few desciptive sentences under each point, once a list is made, would flesh them out a little. Many won't make it, while many would be added. But they surely form the basis with each point usually ending up as a post of it's own.

3) SET TARGETS :  Setting some goals for a series, as to how many points would suffice a topic, would help us decide how long it will run for. So it's good to know up front what we're aiming for, so we think about questions of how many posts, how many we'll post per week, how long the series will run, etc.

4) SET UP DRAFT POSTS : Taking up the list we've created so far, we would take whatever we've penned down within each post(keywords, phrases, sentences), and copy paste them into some drafts on our blogs or posts. We've would also give each one a draft title(often changed later), and just leave them as drafts for us to work on in the coming days.

5) PICKING A TITLE : The name that we give our seires can actually be a very important factor in it's sucess, and should be given serious consideration. In this decision, we must think about branding and how the series would be marketed. Picking the title for a series is pretty similar to the process of choosing one for individual posts that is catchy as well as choosing something with some good keywords in it(for SEO purposes).

6) ANNOUNCE THE SERIES : Uptil this point, all our work was private, but now we shall put pressure on ourselves by announcing the series with an introductory post. This serves a number of purposes including letting readers know what to expect(it creates some anticipation) but also making us accountable and motivated to finish what we've started. 

7) WRITE AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SERIES - The introductory post is generally the same one that we'd do the announcement in. In it, we'll try to do 2 things. Firstly, we'll outline where we'll be headed over the coming days. This might even include announcing the actual topics(if we're that organised) but could be more general also. Secondly ( and more importantly), the focus of the introductory post is to help highlight the 'need' that the series will help to address. I have read testimonials from multiple bloggers stating that the most successful posts and series of posts that they've written have been popular because they meet some of the need that people have.

8) WRITE X POSTS PER WEEK : There are basically 2 approaches for this - either bank up your library of posts in advance and set them to go off over a future period of time or being consistent in writing posts. While the former may help many, but most prefer the latter, mainly for two reasons - this method tends to keep their posts fresh, as it's usually found that until readers begin to interact with the series that the series really take off and then starting to write best stuff after reading comments. And writing in advance doesn't give them the opportunity to build what we're writing upon the wider community's experience. The other reason is because writing multiple posts on one topic in a short time is too much to handle and manage. But either approaches are subject to personal preferences.

9) INTERLINK YOUR POSTS : This is a common mistake that many bloggers make, that they don't provide links to any of their other posts. While current regular readers will be able to follow our post by logging on each day, future readers might not has a much luck as they often come in via a search engine to a middle post in the series and if we haven’t linked to the rest, the will have to go searching for it. These are some ways of interlinking our series: 1) Central Page - A page dedicated to just feature different series, much like youtube playlists. Our introductory post can also be central page. 2) Links at the beginning and/or end of posts. 3) Combine all the posts on a central page to make a longer post.

10) FINISH YOUR SERIES WELL - Readers do like closure and a firm conclusion of a series, and it's often good to finish a series with a short summary of what's been written and/or reflection on the process of writing the series itself. Especially  helpful in a concluding post (or just a concluding paragraph in the last post) is the invitation for readers to add their own thoughts and points. On most occasions, a series could have other posts added to it and so it’s a good thing to acknowledge this and invite others to continue it in comments (or on their own blog). In this way we'll not only get reader interaction but also develop a more well rounded coverage of the topic as our readers add their own expertise and experience.



Some general tips:
********************

>> Keep each post to 500-650 words. Keep each post simple and succinct. If you’re typically less wordy, add more images to give the post more “meat.” If your post pushes past 1000 words, it may need to go into 2 parts.
>> Don’t start a series in the middle of the week. Unless the series is a weekly feature running on a scheduled weekday indefinitely, try to start your series on Monday or Tuesday.
>> Preview the next post. As you finish each post in your series, give your readers a snippet of what’s to come. Example: “Now that we’ve finished talking about making the perfect Valentine’s Day cake, come back tomorrow, when I’ll share with you how to create a gorgeous Valentine’s Day tablescape.“
>> Review the last post. As you start a new post in the series, review what you just covered. Example: “Yesterday we talked about making a perfect Valentine’s Day cake (include link to yesterday’s post!). Today, I’ll give you 4 easy steps to make a beautiful tablescape.”
>> Interlink posts. Every time you have a chance to interlink posts within a series, do it! Also, if you’ve written other posts on this same, or related topics, include those in your posts as well. You can do this within the post content, or you can add an “additional resources” section at the end of the post. Example: “If you liked this Valentine’s Day entertaining series, be sure to check out  my series last year on Easter brunches.”
>> Consider experts/guest posters. If you want to do a series but don’t have the expertise to cover each and every aspect, invite an expert to guest post for you on the topics you’re shaky on. This will enhance your credibility to your readers. We can also feature interviews of guests on our blogs/series.
