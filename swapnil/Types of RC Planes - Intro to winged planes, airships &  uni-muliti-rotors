.broadly 2 categories:
Fixed-wing airplanes ( glider, powered glider/sailplane, vintage, floatplane/seaplane, trainer, sport/aerobatic, scale, warbirds, etc.)
Helicopters ( single rotor, coaxial, multirotors i.e. di/tri/quad/hexcopters), also autogyros, airships,

There are many types of radio-controlled aircraft. For beginning hobbyists, there are park flyers and trainers. For more experienced pilots there are glow plug 
engine, electric powered and sailplane aircraft. For expert flyers, jets, pylon racers, helicopters, autogyros, 3D aircraft, and other high-end competition aircraft
provide adequate challenge. Some models are made to look and operate like a bird instead. Replicating historic and little known types and makes of full-size aircraft
as "flying scale" models, which are also possible with control line and free flight types of model aircraft, actually reach their maximum realism and behavior when
built for radio-control flying.

Types of RC planes: 
>> Fixed wings, no props OR power: RC gliders/sailplanes.powered gliders(retractable motor & props), MIT Ionic plane, multiwings.
>> Fixed wings, motored: Vintage, floatplanes, trainers, sports & aerobatics planes, warbirds, warjets, delta, flying wings, RC trike plane. 
>> Retractable winged planes: Most advanced, hybrid-plane+drone+land, control surfaces- less- magmaUAV.
>> No wings, but ability to fly - Hovercrafts, hybrid models, drones, etc.
